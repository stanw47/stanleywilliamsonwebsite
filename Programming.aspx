        <h1 class="text-center">Programming Experience</h1>
        <p class="text-center">In terms of Programming, I have learned scripting from using NodeJS working with Career.Place. Most of the knowledge I have though, is from experience playing
            around with things. Most of my exposure is to Microsoft Products & Services, which is why this site was created with a .NET Framework, jQuery, and Bootstrap.<br />
            The other website where I did my Market Crach project was made with ASP.NET Core 3.1. I took a Data Science course made by Johns Hopkins which gave me exposure to R.
            I've worked with and used HTML and CSS since my childhood, and Javascript is more recent for me. I have experience with PowerShell and Bash, mostly because of Azure. I also have experience using Azure and GitHub for source control, so I am well aware of where to publish, when to publish, and how to make sure I do not lose my work.<br />
            In terms of whether or not I can program with any other languages in another context, I have a process for figuring out how to accomplish a task with the language. First, I will look at example code and
            determine what pieces of code do what. I will take a piece of code and intentionally get it to not function, since it is easier to know what NOT to do than what to do. I will also determine what pieces of code are specifically contextual, and can only be used in the context of the example code I found.<br />
            Then next, I will look around in the code to determine what I could take out with the code still being able to run. After that, I will determine how exactly I could get pieces of code to
            function how I need it to in a relatively efficient way. I know that less code is not always a good thing, so I will dramatically try to shorten code that was initially very long, but
            make sure I don't skimp out on the functional integrity of the program.<br />
            Finally, I will create my own library in the Notepad of my computer in which I will store pieces of code, and note the contexts in which I can use them. This is an important step for me.
            I need my own personal library since I don't exactly know how to do many things without looking them up. Sometimees, I will plan ahead and create a library of code that I can take
            and work with to get to do what I need it to, and I will also note what it is that I need the code to do, and the steps I can take to get it to that point.<br />
            <br />
            That is my process for working with both languages that I know well, and ones that I know nothing about. If you need something done in a language I don't know, I will handle it. That is a promise.
